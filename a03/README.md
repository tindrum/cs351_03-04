Assignment 3 for CS 351 Section 3:
-------

Implement a server to populate a hash from a database text file, 
then listen on a pipe for requests for a record matching a database key (integer).
The server also delivers the looked-up records through a separate pipe.

A client connects to the pipe to send requests, and to another pipe to receive 
looked-up records.

The server uses mutexes to protect a particular linked list for one hash value.
It locks that hash during access, but other threads can access other hash lists.

#### The programming language you used (i.e., C or C++).
This program is written in C++11.


#### How to execute your program.
Create two terminal windows. Since this is a client-server architecture, 
the server will need to be run first in one terminal, 
then the client in the other.

The server first loads a simple 'database', with each line in the format:
<id=integer> <firstName=string, no spaces> <last=string, no spaces><newline>

To execute the server:
`./server <path_to_database_file> <threads=integer>`
e.g. 
`./server namesDB.txt 4`

The server begins and loads the database file into an internal hash
for quick record lookup.

Now the client can be started:
`./client`
The client does not require parameters.

A Makefile is included.
`make clean` will remove object and executable files.
`make` will create `server` and `client` executables.

#### Whether you implemented the extra credit.
This is our implementation for the basic program.
A separate README.md describes our implementation of Bonus 1.

#### Anything special about your submission that we should take note of.
